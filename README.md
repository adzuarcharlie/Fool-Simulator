This project is a simulation of AI entities navigating through a small town
=

There are walkers spawning at predefined places and having a destination randomly picked among predefined points.
They sometimes have to cross roads, to do so they use cross-walks.
If their traffic-light is red, they stop and wait until it turns to green.

There are also cars navigating on the roads and stopping at traffic-lights when they are red.
They avoid collisions with other cars and also *try* to avoid hitting walkers of course.

*This project was made with Unity 2019.2.11f1, there is a build where you can launch*
